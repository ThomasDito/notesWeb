# Simple Notes WebApp

This is a simple web application that provides a basic notes feature using only frontend technologies. It is not yet integrated with any backend or database, so all notes will disappear every time the page is refreshed.

Soon, I plan to continue this project by adding backend integration so the notes can be stored permanently.

This website is one of my personal learning projects, and you are very welcome to use it as a reference or clone it for your own learning purposes.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
